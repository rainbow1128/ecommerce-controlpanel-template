# Control panel - Ecommerce (developing)

It's a nice app for ecommerces developed by me in order to practice the use of react, redux and Laravel (API). 

Used (frontend): 
* JavaScript

* React router
* Redux
* SASS

* PHP 
* Laravel
* Laravel sanctum
* Laravel intervention/image

Application allowes: 
* To create, read, update and delete categories.
* To create, read, update and delete products, upload pictures and assign a category.
* To filter by name to find a product.
* To send emails to the users registered.
* Register users Account. And those users can be banned and depend on what role they have, they will access to the control panel or ecommerce
